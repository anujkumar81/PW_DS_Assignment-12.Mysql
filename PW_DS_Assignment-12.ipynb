    "#Question 1:\n",
    "'''What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.'''\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. Databases can be used to store, manage, and retrieve information efficiently. They are a critical component of many software applications and are used in various industries and contexts to store and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "'''SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are also known as relational databases. They are based on a predefined schema, where data is stored in tables and relationships between the data are established using keys. SQL databases are good for complex query-intensive operations and transactions. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "Structured Data: SQL databases are suitable for structured data, which means data with a fixed schema and well-defined structure.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, which means you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like CPU, RAM, or SSD.\n",
    "ACID Transactions: SQL databases are ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensures that database transactions are processed reliably.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They do not require a fixed schema, so you can insert data without first defining its structure. NoSQL databases are suitable for handling big data and real-time applications. There are different types of NoSQL databases, including document stores (like MongoDB), key-value stores (like Redis), column-family stores (like Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (like Neo4j).\n",
    "'''Unstructured or Semi-structured Data: NoSQL databases are suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data, which means data without a predefined schema.\n",
    "Scalability: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means you can handle more traffic by adding more servers to your NoSQL database.\n",
    "BASE Transactions: NoSQL databases follow the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) which allows for more flexibility and availability than strict ACID compliance.'''"

    "The foreign key in a table points to the primary key in another table. This relationship ensures referential integrity, meaning that data in the referencing table corresponds to the data in the referenced table. Foreign keys are used to establish connections between related information across multiple tables in a database.\n",
